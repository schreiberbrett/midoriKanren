# Experiment: Verse-like Experiments

## The Idea

Just like we can potentially express Curry-like functional-logic programs in midoriKanren, we should be absle to express Verse/Verse Calculus-like programs in midoriKanren.

## Approach

Go through the [2023 ICFP Verse Calulus paper](https://simon.peytonjones.org/verse-calculus/) and see what we can express.

## Future Work

Could potentially create a midoriKanren-like implementation that is optimized for Verse/Verse Calculus.
